## Visual representation of the Central Limit Theorem. 

Below, we observe that as 'n' increases, the binomial distribution converges to the normal distribution. We see that
the binomial distribution continues to become smoother and more symmetric.

We are visually confirming the fact that as sample size
becomes larger, the distribution of the sample mean approaches a 
normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original.

# Set a seed for reproducibility

# Number of observations in each sample
n_values <- c(10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000)

# Generate random samples from Binomial distribution for different N values
for (n in n_values) {
  binomial_data <- rbinom(10000, size = n, prob = 0.5)
  
  # Create histogram using hist() function
  hist(binomial_data, main = paste("Binomial Distribution (N =", n,")"))
  
    # Save the plot as a PNG file
  png(filename = paste("binomial_", n, ".png", sep = ""))

# Generate random samples from Normal distribution for different N values
  normal_data <- rnorm(10000, mean = n * 0.5, sd = sqrt(n * 0.25))
  
  # Create histogram using hist() function
  hist(normal_data, main = paste("Normal Distribution (N =", n, ")"))
  
   # Save the plot as a PNG file
  png(filename = paste("normal_", n, ".png", sep = ""))
